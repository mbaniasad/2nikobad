The seminar and project TITLE (INF-XX-XX-S-X, INF-XX-XX-L-X) are continuative courses based on and applying 
the knowledge taught in the lectures 3D Computer Vision (INF-73-51-V-7) and Computer Vision: Object and People Tracking (INF-73-52-V-7). The goal of the project is to research, design, implement and evaluate
algorithms and methods for tackling computer vision problems.
The seminar is more theoretical. Its educational objective is to train the ability to become acquainted
